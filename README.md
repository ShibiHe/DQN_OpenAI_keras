# DQN_OpenAI_keras
This is the DQN implementation written by myself using OpenAI gym and keras.

### The project is still under construction!

`training.py` is the main script

`agents.py` stores DQN agent

`Parameters.py` stores training parameters

`image_preprocessing` contains image preprocessing functions

`Anti_flickering` shows that only amalgamate two frames odd and even is not enough to obliterate flickering.

`action_difference.py` is a script to show the difference in actions of OpenAI gym and orignial DQN paper, irrelevant to the main functions.
